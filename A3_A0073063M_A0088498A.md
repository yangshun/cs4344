### 1. Interest Management

The game itself features a large game world with ships shooting at each other. Due to the game's simplicity and the player's global POV, there is not much to be optimized since player needs to know pretty much everything that is happening within the game. Hence, we only opmitize 2 events in the game, which are the `hit` and `fire` event.

**Optimize `hit` event** 

For the `hit` event, we noticed that, most clients only use this event to destroy the `rocket`. Only the `ship` that fired the `rocket` and the `ship` that being `hit` use event for score keeping. Therefore, instead of boardcasting the `hit` event to every client, the server sends the `hit` event to 2 clients: the client that owns the `rocket` and the client that owns the `ship` being hit.

`MMOServer.js`

	if (rockets[i] !== undefined && rockets[i].from != j && rockets[i].currCellIndex == ships[j].currCellIndex) {
        if (rockets[i].hasHit(ships[j])) {
            // Only send to the player that fire the rocket (for score keeping)
            // and the player that being hit (for damage calculation)
            var msg = {
                type: "hit",
                rocket: i,
                ship: j
            };
            unicast (rockets[i].from, msg);
            unicast (ships[j].pid, msg);
        }
    } 

Of course we need a way for other clients to know when the rocket is destroyed. In order to achieve this, we let clients simulate collisions and discard any rocket that is collided with ships.

`Client.js`

	var gameloop = function () {
		...

		for (var i in rockets) {
	        rockets[i].moveOneStep();
	        
	        // remove out of bounds rocket
	        if (rockets[i].x < 0 || rockets[i].x > Config.WIDTH ||
	            rockets[i].y < 0 || rockets[i].y > Config.HEIGHT) {
	            rockets[i] = null;
	            delete rockets[i];
	        } else {
	            // Do not check collision status of its own rockets
                // These will be updated by server via 'hit'
                if (rockets[i].from != myShip.pid) {
                    // LOCALLY detect collision and remove the rockets
                    // without alerting the others
                    // TODO: NAIVE IMPLEMENTATION
                    for (var j in ships) {
                        if (rockets[i] != undefined && rockets[i].from != j && ) {
                            if (rockets[i].hasHit(ships[j])) {
                                rockets[i] = null;
                                delete rockets[i];
                            }
                        } 
                    }
                }
	        }
	    }
	}

In this snippet, the client is added an algorithm to detect collision with ships. `Rocket` that are detected hit will be discarded. Here, clients will never check collision status of its own `rocket`, as those `rocket` hit statues should be decided by the server. This is to prevent cases where the `rocket` local collision is detected first and the `rocket` is destroyed before its `hit` event ever has a chance to arrive.

Although effective, this implementation has 2 flaws: first is the client now also need to simulate part of the game (and the simulation implemented here is naive), and second is this implementation will not ensure to work in high latency environment. However, since this game is simple and consistency is not a focus of this assignment, therefore we do not spend more effort improving this solution.

**Optimze `fire` event**

For the `fire` event, we noticed that players, although have global awareness of the game world, do not really interesting in bullets that are far away and hence would never hit. Therefore, we improve the server to selectively skip sending `fire` events that would never hit the player's `ship` to the player no matter how bad he/she plays the game. In order to achieve this, we calculate the potential hit position and check whether the player can deliberately reach that position in time. Here is the diagram explaining the logic:
![](http://i.imgur.com/88mAq67.png)

Basically for each `bullet` upon firing, the server will calculate the `potentialHitPosition`. Then it will use the knowledge of both the `bullet` and `ship` speed to calculate the minimum time taken for both `bullet` and `ship` to tralvel there. If the `ship` can reach the position before the `bullet` does, there are chances that the `bullet` can hit that `ship`, hence server will send `fire` event to the client owning that `ship`. Otherwise, it may choose to skip the event.

This private method is used to check whether the `ship` has chances to be hit by a specific `bullet`:

`MMOServer.js`

	/**
     * private method: canShipBeHit (ship, rocket)
     *
     * test whether the ship may be hit by the rocket.
     * return TRUE if the ship may get hit, FALSE if
     * the ship can not be hit no matter how the ship
     * moves.
     *
     * if error detected, return TRUE as worst case
     *
     * Assumption:
     * ship velocity always smaller than rocket velocity.
     */
    var canShipBeHit = function (ship, rocket) {
        if (ship.VELOCITY >= rocket.VELOCITY) {
            // Ship can always chase the rocket to let them hit
            return true;
        }

        // Potential hit location of the rocket is where the rocket might
        // hit the ship. Ship doesn't need to reach there in time
        var potentialHitLocation = null;

        if ((rocket.dir == "up" && rocket.y >= ship.y) ||
            (rocket.dir == "down" && rocket.y <= ship.y))
        {
            potentialHitLocation = {
                "x" : rocket.x,
                "y" : ship.y
            }
        } else if ((rocket.dir == "left" && rocket.x >= ship.x) ||
                   (rocket.dir == "right" && rocket.x <= ship.x))
        {
            potentialHitLocation = {
                "x" : ship.x,
                "y" : rocket.y
            }
        } else {
            // No potentialHitLocation detected. Ship cannot be hit!
            return false;
        }

        // Distance and time required for rocket to reach the potential hit location
        var rocketTravelDis =   Math.abs (rocket.x - potentialHitLocation.x) + 
                                Math.abs (rocket.y - potentialHitLocation.y);
        var rocketTravelTime = rocketTravelDis / rocket.getVelocity ();

        // Distance required for ship to reach to potential hit location
        // We calculate the shortest path, since ship can warp around world
        var shipTravelDis;
        if (ship.x == potentialHitLocation.x) {
            var diff = Math.abs (ship.y - potentialHitLocation.y);
            shipTravelDis = Math.min (diff, Config.HEIGHT - diff);
        } else if (ship.y == potentialHitLocation.y) {
            var diff = Math.abs (ship.x - potentialHitLocation.x);
            shipTravelDis = Math.min (diff, Config.WIDTH - diff);
        } else {
            console.log ("Something wrong in canShipBeHit function. Return true as worst case");
            return true;
        }
        var shipTravelTime = shipTravelDis / ship.getVelocity ();

        // Ship cannot never be hit when ship cannot reach the potential position in time
        return shipTravelTime < rocketTravelTime;
    }

This snippet controls whether the 'fire' event is sent to the client:

`MMOServer.js`

	case "fire":
        ...
        
        for (var i in ships) {
            // Only send message to ship that fired the rocket
            // or that are likely to be hit
            if (i == pid || canShipBeHit (ships[i], rockets[rocketId])) {
                // If that ship can be hit, tell it
                var msg = {
                    type: "fire",
                    ship: pid,
                    rocket: rocketId,
                    x: message.x,
                    y: message.y,
                    dir: message.dir,
                };
                unicast (i, msg);
            }
        }

        break;

***NOTE:** In the actual code submitted, we let the server send `fire` message to other ships anyway, but under a different event, named `fire-not-interested`. `Rocket` spawned by this event will be rendered in different color. This feature is for demonstration purposes. You can turn off by setting `Config.DEBUG_MODE` to `false`*

This implementation helps cut down a huge amount networking traffic without altering the actual game mechanics. However, the game look and feel would be different, hence player's experience might not be the same as before.

**Further optimization**

 We observed and analyzed both solutions described above and come up with an extra implementation to help reduce the drawbacks of those solutions. We observed that, if network bandwidth allow extra events to be send, it will help reduce the negative effects of interest management by purposely sending extra  `hit` and `fire` events. As mention earlier, extra `hit` event might help clients destroy `rocket` that missed by local detection (due to state inconsistency) while extra `fire` event might help reserving the look and feel of the original game.

In order to do so, server needs to keep track of the outcoming sending rate. The sending rate is recorded in `currentThroughput` using this snippet:

`MMOServer.js`

	function MMOServer() {
		...

		var totalPacketSent = 0;        // Keep track of the outgoing packets sent
	    var currentThroughput = 0;      // Current sending rate of the server

		...

	    var calculateThroughput = function () {
	        // Update the current throughput variable
	        currentThroughput = totalPacketSent / Config.THROUGHPUT_CALCULATION_DURATION * 1000;
	
	        // Reset the count for next interval
	        totalPacketSent = 0;
	
	        console.log ("Current sending rate (packet/s): " + Math.round (currentThroughput));
	    }

		var gameLoop = function () {
			...
			setInterval(function() {calculateThroughput();}, Config.THROUGHPUT_CALCULATION_DURATION);
		}

We estimate the network sending rate upperbound by using this calculation:
	
	maxSendRate = MAX_ESTIMATE_SEND_RATE_PER_USER * totalNumberUsers

We estimate each user will need to be updated maximum 25 times per second (around 1 packet every 2 frames, providing game is running at 40fps)

If the current sending rate is below the upperbound, events which would be skipped will be sent. Otherwise, they will always be skipped:

`MMOServer.js`
	
	case "fire":
		...
		var sendNormal = false;		// After the "if" statement, packet will be send when sendNormal is true
		if (i == pid || canShipBeHit (ships[i], rockets[rocketId])) {
	        // If that ship can be hit, tell it
	        sendNormal = true;
	    } else if (currentThroughput < Config.MAX_ESTIMATE_SEND_RATE_PER_USER * Object.keys(players).length) {
	        // Send if the bandwidth is underused
	        sendNormal = true;
	    }

### 2. Improved collision detection:
